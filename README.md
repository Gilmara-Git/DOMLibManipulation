<h1 align="center">DOM Manipulation LIB</h1>

## About

This lib was created to manipulated any DOM elements in a faster way.

# Objectives

Put in practive my 'JS' learnings during course JavaScript Ninja with [Fernando Daciuk](https://github.com/fdaciuk)

## Details:
To create the 'lib' I have used a constructor function 'DOM' that receives a 'string'  as a parameter, which will be a NODE.

## Events created:
- A method 'on' to add events to the elements.
 - A method 'off' to remove events from the elements.

## Methods created:
- forEach()
- map()
- filter()
- reduce()
- reduceRight()
- every()
- some()

### Static methods to verify object types:
 - DOM.isArray();
 - DOM.isObject();
 - DOM.isFunction();
 - DOM.isNumber();
 - DOM.isString();
 - DOM.isBoolean();
 - DOM.isNull();



## Languages/Technologies

- Html5 (Hypertext)
